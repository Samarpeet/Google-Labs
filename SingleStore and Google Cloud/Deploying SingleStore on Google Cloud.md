# ☁️ Deploying SingleStore on Google Cloud — My Lab Notes

Hey there! 👋  
This page documents my hands-on experience with deploying **SingleStore** on **Google Cloud**. Everything here is based on the actual labs I’ve completed and tested — feel free to refer to the scripts and notes if you're doing something similar.

## ⚠️ Quick Note from Me

This guide and the scripts included are shared **purely for educational purposes**. My aim is to help others (and my future self!) understand how these services work in real lab environments.  
Before you dive in:

- Please **read through the script** first so you're clear on what's happening.
- Always respect the rules of the learning platforms — including **Qwiklabs' Terms of Service** and **YouTube’s Community Guidelines**.
- This isn't meant to shortcut the learning process, but to **support** it with real, working examples.

### Run the following Commands in CloudShell

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samarpeet/Google-Labs/refs/heads/main/SingleStore%20and%20Google%20Cloud/Samar.sh
sudo chmod +x Samar.sh
./Samar.sh
```

## 🌍 Zones, Regions & VM Setup

A couple of things to keep in mind while following along:

- The **Zone** and **Region** settings can be changed to match your location or lab requirements.
- **VM configurations** might vary depending on what the lab or use case demands — the ones I’ve used worked for me, but feel free to tweak as needed.
